God is the foundation of logic.
There is no everlasting burning hell in which he gives eternal life to those that burn there.

He works in mysterious ways and those who worship themselves cannot see it.

The lion will rest with the child and there will be no more warfare.

Once they march on Jerusalem then it will be complete and God and his children will have peace.
