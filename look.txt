The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. The cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day and fire was on it by night.

Clean you feet and your hands before you work for God in the tabernacle.

Observe the world and the only way to achieve understanding is by embracing humility, to understand that you ware nothing but a moment in time.

We are meant to become Gods and to walk with God.

Clean yourself and behave appropriate, read the ways of God and separate yourself from the dung.
